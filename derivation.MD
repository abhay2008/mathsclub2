## Cross-Multiplication Formula for Solving Linear Systems

The cross-multiplication formula is used to find the solutions (x and y) of a system of two linear equations:

a_1x + b_1y + c_1 = 0
a_2x + b_2y + c_2 = 0

### Determinant (Δ)

The determinant (Δ) of the system is calculated as follows:

Δ = a_1b_2 - a_2b_1

### Cross-Multiplication Formulas

The values of x and y are then determined using the cross-multiplication formulas:

x = (Δ_x) / Δ = (b_1c_2 - b_2c_1) / Δ

y = (Δ_y) / Δ = (a_2c_1 - a_1c_2) / Δ

Where:
- Δ_x is obtained by replacing a_1 and a_2 with c_1 and c_2 in the determinant.
- Δ_y is obtained by replacing b_1 and b_2 with c_1 and c_2 in the determinant.

These formulas provide a method for solving systems of linear equations by expressing x and y in terms of determinants.
