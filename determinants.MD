## Determinants in Linear Algebra

Determinants are mathematical quantities associated with square matrices. The determinant of a matrix is denoted by det(A) or |A|, where A is the matrix.

### For a 2x2 Matrix:

For a 2x2 matrix:

A = | a  b |
    | c  d |

The determinant is calculated as:

det(A) = |A| = ad - bc

### For a 3x3 Matrix:

For a 3x3 matrix:

B = | a  b  c |
    | d  e  f |
    | g  h  i |

The determinant is calculated as:

det(B) = |B| = a(ei - fh) - b(di - fg) + c(dh - eg)

Determinants are used in various areas of mathematics and physics. They play a crucial role in solving systems of linear equations and determining properties of linear transformations.

Remember, if the determinant of a matrix is zero, it indicates that the matrix is singular, and the system of equations associated with it may have either no solution or infinitely many solutions.
